One of the ideas that informed our story was the conversations in the class about the idea of blackboxing. We hoped to, at least to some extent, make the program transparent to the reader. This led to us pursuing the idea of making a BASIC program about making a BASIC program. We wanted to make the user aware of how the program functioned, so we planned a segment of the story to involve learning how to code in BASIC. While we could not teach all of BASIC, we were able to get to most of the most essential elements (PRINT, conditionals, variables, inputs).
